#called so because of numerical python , 2005 by travis oliphant 
#numpy is package for multi-D data , math functions , linear algebra , all matrix operations and their rules , arrays 
# arrays are used here -- they store elements in continous memory locations  , store item of fix size / name and same datatype , easy for maths operation

import numpy as np

# l1 = [1,2,3]
# l2 = [4,5,6]
# print(l1+l2)  this gives the concatenation not the sum

file1 = np.array([10,20,30,40,50])
file2 = np.array([60,70,80,90,100])
print("my file1 is \n",file1)
print("my file2 is \n",file2)
